## 📱 What is Dristi OS?

**Dristi OS** is a **resource-demanding, barely-working mock operating system**.  
It’s a chaotic love letter to Linux and Android — but with none of their powers.

You can only do one thing:  
🎮 **Play the Android game _Vag Hasina Vag_** (yes, that's it).

Everything else?  
Nope. You can't do anything properly. On purpose. Because... **aesthetic**.

## 🖥️ Features (kinda)

- ✅ Looks like Android and Linux had a weird baby
- ✅ Boots (sometimes)
- ✅ Has an **empty shell** (don’t ask why, there's no point)
- ❌ Productivity? Nope
- ❌ File system? Lol
- ❌ Multitasking? Never heard of her

## 🔧 How to Run It (If You Dare)

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ovishkh/dristi-os.git
   cd dristi-os

2. Build the OS and create an ISO:

   ```bash
   # Use your favorite build tool (you’ll know if you know)
   ./build.sh
   ```

3. Run it on VMware or VirtualBox (physical hardware not recommended unless you hate your PC).

## ⚠️ Warnings

* **Resource hungry**: This OS *demands* your CPU’s soul
* **Not usable**: Seriously, it’s mostly for vibes
* **Empty shell**: There’s literally no shell commands. It’s just there.
* **Not production-ready**: Unless your production is a meme
